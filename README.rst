Filework
========

FileWork is a class for simplifying work with files.  Most of the tedious code for working with a file is contained in 
the class, so the calling code doesn't need to bother with it.

A FileWork object can:

1. Create a file
2. Write to a File
3. Append content to a File
4. Read the entire contents of a File
5. Read a file one line at a time
6. Open or Close the Connection to a File
7. Delete a File

There is sphinx-generated documentation: the main page is docs/html/index.html. Included in the documentation is a Usage
file (docs/html/usage.html) which provides a simple and hopefully helpful explanation about how the methods work and how
to call them.

This module was originally created for the waxtablet application.
